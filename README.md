# Overview of HRHD-HK

This paper presents a benchmark dataset of high-rise hig-density urban point clouds, namely High-Rise, High-Density urban scenes of Hong Kong (HRHD-HK) for 3D semantic segmentation.

* The semantic labels of HRHD-HK include 1) building, 2) vegetation, 3) road, 4) waterbody, 5) facility, 6) terrain, and 7) vehicle.
* Point clouds of HRHD-HK were collected in HK with two features, i.e., color and coordinates in the HK 1980 Grid system (EPSG:2326).
* HRHD-HK arranged in 150 tiles, contain approximately 273 million points, covering 9.375 km<sup>2</sup>.
* Each tile of point clouds was saved in the "ply" format with seven channels, i.e., x, y, z, red, green, blue, and label.
* HRHD-HK aims to supplement the existing benchmark datasets with Asian HRHD urban scenes as well as subtropical natural landscapes, such as sea, vegetation, and mountains.

HRHD-HK is now available at the HKU Data Repository.
